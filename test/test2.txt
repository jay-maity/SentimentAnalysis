48::the kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you
49::though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan \( a first time actor \) , writer director achero manas 's film is schematic and obvious

117::audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones

139::the film 's taste for shock humor will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers
140::earnest but earthbound a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast
141::imagine a film that begins as a seven rip off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s
142::a genuinely moving and wisely unsentimental drama
143::everything you loved about it in 1982 is still there , for everybody who wants to be a kid again , or show it to their own kids
144::though it 's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to leigh for actually casting people who look working class
145::it 's a long way from orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry 1984 to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation
146::a loud , low budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama '
147::the beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep

149::i do n't think this movie loves women at all
150::that rare movie that works on any number of levels as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults

152::what makes barbershop so likable , with all its flaws , is that it has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies
153::a charmer from belgium
154::a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity
155::while glover , the irrepressible eccentric of river 's edge , dead man and back to the future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents bartleby 's main overall flaw
156::a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters it 's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter
157::whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout \? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche
158::it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense
159::the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we ca n't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo
160::clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades
161::even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good
162::about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces positively dreadful
163::a very funny romantic comedy about two skittish new york middle agers who stumble into a relationship and then struggle furiously with their fears and foibles

166::insomnia is one of the year 's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances
167::fluffy neo noir hiding behind cutesy film references
168::filled with low brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life
169::manages to accomplish what few sequels can it equals the original and in some ways even betters it

171::an elegant , exquisitely modulated psychological thriller
172::often overwrought and at times positively irritating , the film turns into an engrossing thriller almost in spite of itself

174::the movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances
175::a coming of age film that avoids the cartoonish clich s and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood
176::a real story about real people living their lives concerned about the future of an elderly , mentally handicapped family member
177::despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype
178::a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one 's appetite for the bollywood films
179::unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic
180::plays out with a dogged and eventually winning squareness that would make it the darling of many a kids and family oriented cable channel
181::like a medium grade network sitcom mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen

184::it 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002
185::family portrait of need , neurosis and nervy negativity is a rare treat that shows the promise of digital filmmaking
186::an asian neo realist treasure
187::one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution
188::so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines
189::i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho 's
190::what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie in other words , it 's badder than bad
191::to some eyes this will seem like a recycling of clich s , an assassin 's greatest hits to others , it will remind them that hong kong action cinema is still alive and kicking
192::though it flirts with bathos and pathos and the further oprahfication of the world as we know it , it still cuts all the way down to broken bone

201::gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance
202::aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music

204::the central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest
205::the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail

207::pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle
208::moretti is the rare common man artist who 's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex and , as it turns out , more fragile than happiness
209::a pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film
210::in theory , a middle aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life
211::light , cute and forgettable

213::this time out , sade is an unsettlingly familiar figure in turns loyal and deceitful , responsible and reckless , idealistically selfless and coldly self interested

215::l stima por schwarzenegger , pero es hora de que deje la estafeta a las nuevas generaciones
216::while centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches ever so gracefully on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel
217::lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings
218::it 's push the limits teen comedy , the type written by people who ca n't come up with legitimate funny , and it 's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed
219::white has n't developed characters so much as caricatures , one dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else
220::one of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch
221::the emperor 's club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality
222::although german cooking does not come readily to mind when considering the world 's best cuisine , mostly martha could make deutchland a popular destination for hungry tourists
223::the film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies

225::if they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands i kept looking for the last exit from brooklyn

245::it 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca n't bring yourself to dislike it
246::a feel good picture in the best sense of the term
247::a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending certainly the big finish was n't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps
248::the wonderful combination of the sweetness and the extraordinary technical accomplishments of the first film are maintained , but its overall impact falls a little flat with a storyline that never quite delivers the original magic
249::plays in broad outline as pandering middle age buddy comedy
250::if you can swallow its absurdities and crudities lagaan really is enormously good fun
251::every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable something like scrubbing the toilet or emptying rat traps or doing last year 's taxes with your ex wife
252::you 've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles , but it 's worth yet another visit
253::kung pow is oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that
254::featherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock

256::it proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study
257::another in your face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues

261::madonna has made herself over so often now , there 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson 's nose
262::it 's a testament to de niro and director michael caton jones that by movie 's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all
263::the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable na vet and arbitrary flashbacks
264::its generic villains lack any intrigue \( other than their funny accents \) and the action scenes are poorly delivered
